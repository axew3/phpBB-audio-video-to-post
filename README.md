# phpBB Audio Video to posts Recorder and Player

### (Help and examples are Under Construction)

Actually only audio (not video) recorder for phpBB

## Install

Copy the "w3all" folder into 
### phpBB/ext/

So you'll have: 
### phpBB/ext/w3all/w3audiovideotopost

Go to "ACP" > "Customise" > "Extensions" and enable the "Audio Player and Recorder on Posts" extension

Done

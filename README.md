## Version 1.0.0

# phpBB Audio Video to posts Recorder and Player
### Use phpBB mp3 attachments like Telegram or Whatsapp discussion.
### It is so fast, easy, light and secure.

Actually only audio (not video) recorder for phpBB

## Update/install: 

If updating, disable the old version and delete data into ACP Extensions Manager

Remove the folder 
#### w3audiovideotopost 
into
    
    /ext/w3all/

then follow installing the new version

## Install

Copy the "w3all" folder into 
### phpBB/ext/

So you'll have: 
### phpBB/ext/w3all/w3audiovideotopost

Go to "ACP" > "Customise" > "Extensions" and enable the "Audio Player and Recorder on Posts" extension

Done

## How do i can style it?

## CSS:

    /ext/w3all/w3audiovideotopost/styles/prosilver/template/css/style.css
